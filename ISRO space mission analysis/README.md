# Project Title

The "Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) Spacecraft Missions - 2023" dataset provides an exhaustive record of spacecraft missions conducted by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) during the year 2023. ISRO, known for its prowess in launching satellites to meet diverse customer requirements, has released a range of spacecraft/satellites as per the needs of its clientele. This dataset offers a comprehensive view of ISRO's contribution to space exploration and satellite deployment.


## Objective

- Extracting list of applications and orbit types these missions served.
- Gather information about most successful years, highly relevent launch vehicles.
- Finding Success percentage in each orbit, failures and overall success rate.
- Applying SQL fundamentals and queries to extract other important inferences.
## Tools

MySQL Workbench
## Functions Used

- String Functions
- Window Functions
- Regular Expressions
- Aggregate Functions
- Common Table Expression
- Temporary Table

## Insights

- ISRO has been active for 48 years, serving a broad spectrum of applications, primarily in communication(30.4%), earth observation(28.8%) and experimental applications(8.8%) across major orbits like Geosynchronous Orbit (GSO), Sun-Synchronous Polar Orbit (SSPO), and Low Earth Orbit (LEO).
- ISRO’s overall mission success rate stands at an impressive 89.6%, reflecting its reliability in space exploration and satellite deployment.
- The Sun-Synchronous Polar Orbit (SSPO) has recorded the highest success, with 100% success across all missions, whereas missions to Geosynchronous Orbit (GSO) and Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) show a slightly lower success rate, at 83%, marking these orbits with the least success rate.
- On average, ISRO launches three missions per year, maintaining a steady pace in its contributions to space technology and applications.
- The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is ISRO’s most successful and trusted launch vehicle, consistently achieving successful missions.
- The longest gaps between two consecutive ISRO missions occurred during 1975-1979 and 1983-1987, marking extended periods without mission launches in ISRO’s early years.
- 2018 and 2022 were milestone years for ISRO, achieving a perfect record with all 9 launches in each year completed successfully.

## Lessons Learned

- Different techniques of loading data into workbench.
- Applications of CTE in simplifying complex queries.
- Combining window functions with CTE to improve query efficiency.
- Use of Temporary table in data preprocessing.
